He followed this with dominant championship victories in 2022 and 2023, breaking numerous records along the way, including the most wins in a single season.",

His precision, race craft, and ability to extract maximum performance from his Red Bull RB20 have made him a formidable force on every circuit. Beyond the statistics, it's his unwavering commitment to excellence and his ability to perform under pressure that truly sets him apart."
